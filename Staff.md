        the given Staff or Management member, they are required to
        recuse themselves from the decision.
    
    12. Due to the way the M.O.A. and the M.O.L. are managed, members of
        both groups are still required to recuse themselves if they have
        a lower ranking member able to handle the scenario; if that is
        not the case, the member can continue without recusal
    
    13. **Non-Mandatory Recusals** – in situations where a person may be
        biased or unable to impart a fair or unprejudiced judgement,
        this contract strongly advises that the person recuse themselves

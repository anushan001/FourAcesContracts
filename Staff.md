## Terms of Staff

1.  All Staff members MUST first read through, understand and sign this
    contract.

2.  All staff members MUST also follow the Terms of Membership

3.  On signing this contract, the signee acknowledges they will follow:
    
    1.  All other requirements or terms contained within these Terms
    
    2.  Any additional rules or requirements placed by the Council of
        the Casino

4.  You agree to perform your duties without bias, without prejudice and
    with the intent to provide a sense of pride and accomplishment to
    players at this Casino.

5.  As such, you agree to not ‘rig’ games intentionally to cause any one
    player or Staff to have an advantage that is deemed unfair by the
    Staff.

6.  In any situation where there is a contradiction between two Staff
    member’s orders or instructions, the highest-authority staff
    member’s instruction is enforced. If both members are of the same
    authority, then the Casino Management MUST break the stand-off
    
    3.  If the contradiction is between Casino Management, then the
        Owner breaks the stand-off

7.  Division Heads MUST send information regarding who is employed, and
    the Division’s hierarchy to the ‘FourAces\#1702’ (Four Aces Casino)
    discord account, for such information to be recorded.

8.  As a Staff, you MAY be punished by the Casino Management for failing
    to perform your duties, or performing your duties to a degree that
    is negligible or otherwise unacceptable to the Casino.
    
    4.  Punishments CAN only be given by Staff higher in rank, and MUST
        be fair
    
    5.  While acting as a Staff member, the Staff member CANNOT be
        terminated from Membership, they MUST first be Terminated from
        their staff position, and after a minimum of one (1) day, be
        Terminated from Membership.
    
    6.  Punishments are issued by the M.O.A. on behalf of Management.

9.  Management refers to the Casino’s Council, which consists of the
    Division Heads and the Owner.

10. **Staff and Management Mandatory Recusals**
    
    7.  Under situations where a punishment or decision would apply to
        the given Staff or Management member, they are required to
        recuse themselves from the decision.
    
    8.  Due to the way the M.O.A. and the M.O.L. are managed, members of
        both groups are still required to recuse themselves if they have
        a lower ranking member able to handle the scenario; if that is
        not the case, the member CAN continue without recusal
    
    9.  **Non-Mandatory Recusals** – in situations where a person MAY be
        biased or unable to impart a fair or unprejudiced judgement,
        this contract strongly advises that the person recuse themselves

## Termination of Staff

  - This contract MAY be terminated by either the signee or by their
    direct supervisor, or by a majority decision from higher members of
    Casino Management.

  - Once Staff-ship has been terminated, you are no longer required to
    abide by these Terms, or any rules or regulations imposed *directly
    due to being a Staff member*.

  - Immediately upon termination, you are no longer able to nor required
    to perform your roles, responsibilities or authorities of the Staff
    role you had.

  - Despite being Terminated as a Staff member, you will still withhold
    your Membership of the Casino for at least one (1) day. After one
    (1) from Staff termination, you MAY then be terminated from
    Membership.

## Division Budgets

1.  Each of the Divisions will have their own Budget, whose value will
    be publically known by any Casino Member, but SHALL only be set or
    changed by the Owner, or, due to ease of use, Alex.

2.  This Budget MAY be increased due to profits gained specifically to
    that Division, for example (but not necessarily limited to):
    
    1.  M.O.A. Citations;
    
    2.  M.O.G. Rakes and Blackjack profits;
    
    3.  M.O.L. Loan profits

3.  These profits from each Division MAY be split, in such a fashion
    that the Casino gets x% of the profit, and the Division has the
    remainder within their Budget.

4.  The Divisions Budget MAY be used on certain things, for example, the
    M.O.L.’s budget would be used to issue loans, and other uses MAY
    become apparent.

5.  The Divisions budget SHALL also be used to pay wages to the
    Division’s employees:
    
    4.  The Division Head SHALL issue a wage to each Member, but SHOULD
        pay a minimum of 25 chips per employee, and MUST NOT exceed 350
        chips per employee. They MAY give a wage to their discretion,
        assuming it does not contradict these Terms.
    
    5.  If the Division does not have enough budget to pay each of its
        employees the 25 chips minimum, then the Casino’s pot MAY be
        used, but only to cover the minimum 25 chips.
        
        1.  This only applies if the Member has not received any chips
            from any Division’s wage.
    
    6.  If a Member is employed across multiple Divisions, they MAY only
        be guaranteed just one 25 chip. Additionally, a Member SHALL NOT
        receive any more than 500 chips, in total, from their wages.

## Modification of this Contract

1.  Any modifications to this Contract MUST first be submitted by Alex
    to the Staff Members of the Casino.

2.  While a majority vote or approval is not required, the Owner MAY
    overrule the contract and disregard any changes made to it.

3.  Alex MAY be directed to institute changes by the Council, which
    SHALL be performed as soon as is reasonable possible.

4.  If the contract is not overruled by the Owner, then:
    
    1.  If the new contract is presented prior to 4:30 pm, the contract
        SHALL be valid and enforceable from midnight that day.
    
    2.  If the new contract is presented after 4:30 pm, then the
        contract SHALL be valid from 3 pm the day after it is presented.
    
    3.  If the new contract is presented on a day in which no Casino
        games have occurred (ie: weekends or holidays) then the new
        contract SHALL be valid from the midnight of that day.

5.  This contract CANNOT be held to invalidate terms of the Membership
    contract, unless such a term allows for such an exemption to occur.

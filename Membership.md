    stated otherwise)
    
      - *Super majority:* where two thirds of the votes meets a result.

        a result (rounded in same way as above.)

<sup>1</sup> – While people have been named, their employment can be

## Roles within the Casino

  - **Member** is any person that has accepted this Membership contract
    and has been accepted into the Casino

  - **Staff** is any person that has signed the Staff contract and that
    has been hired/employed by the Casino. Staff members include the
    following:

  - **Dealer** is an individual that has been allowed to deal games
    within the Casino

  - **Head Dealer** is an individual that oversees the actions,
    responsibilities and duties of dealers

  - **Council Member** is any person who is a Division Head and is as
    such a sitting member of the Casino’s Council.

## Actionable Verbs

  - The terms “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “MUST” or “MUST NOT” indicate
    requirements to be followed strictly in order to conform to the
    Contract and from which no deviation is permitted.

  - The terms “SHOULD” and “SHOULD NOT” indicate that among several
    possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without
    mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action
    is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the negative
    form) a certain possibility or course of action is discouraged but
    not prohibited.

  - The terms “MAY” and “NEED NOT” indicate a course of action
    permissible within the limits of the Contract

  - The terms “CAN” and “CANNOT” indicate a possibility and capability,
    whether material, physical or causal or, in the negative, the
    absence of that possibility or capability.

## Departments / Divisions

  - **Ministry of Admissions**
    
      - **M.O.A.** staff members MUST be Members of the Casino and are
        appointed by the Division Head; their objective is to ensure
        that the M.O.A. makes valid and just decisions. They report any
        contractual oversights or infringements to the M.O.A. Inspector
        and advise that Inspector and The Council on new Memberships.
    
      - **M.O.A. Inspector** supervises the M.O.A. and officially hands
        citations and awards, with advice from M.O.A. staff. The M.O.A.
        Inspector will receive requests for citations from any
        Investigation that is opened, in such a case, the MOA Inspector
        SHALL make a fair and valid decision given probable cause that
        an incident violated the terms.

  - **Ministry of Loans**
    
      - **M.O.L.** staff members MAY be any Member of the Casino. They
        MAY: recommend the best loan to Members that are looking to get
        one; advertise loans to Members, within reason; and give
        recommendations to The Council on who is to be given a loan,
        given a personal assessment of that person’s finance.
    
      - **M.O.L.** **Supervisor** supervises the M.O.L. and presents any
        possible loans to The Council for approval.

  - **Ministry of Games**
    
      - **M.O.G.** staff members assist in the day-to-day running of
        games; the proper auditing of chips within the Casino; and the
        recording of games missed by members. The M.O.G. MUST work
        closely with the M.O.A. due to the nature of possible punishment
        against Members.
    
      - **M.O.G. Supervisor** supervises all actions of the M.O.G. and
        has the authority to directly issue citations related to the
        M.O.G.’s authority.

Each of these Division Heads (M.O.A. Inspector, M.O.G. Supervisor,
M.O.L. Supervisor) is entirely responsible for the duties and
responsibilities and wages of their Division and their Division’s staff.

Additionally, henceforth, a Council is established that consists of the
Division Heads of all Ministries, and the Owner. This Council will have
the authority to make decisions that span numerous departments’
authorities, or that would impact the entirety of the Casino as a whole
or a decision that would be outside the purview of any singular
department, or in any instance where the Casino’s chip pot is involved.
The Council’s decision SHALL override any decision of a Division. The
Council MAY be required to have an input prior to any Division’s
decision (for example, issuing or changing the values of MOL loans)

## I: General Terms of Play

1.  Only people that have: read thoroughly, agree to and have signed the
    contract are able to partake in activities. All players MUST remain
    respectful, lawful and orderly.

2.  On signing this contract, the signee acknowledges and will follow:
    
    1.  All requirements or terms contained within these Terms of
        Membership
    
    2.  Any additional rules or requirements placed by Staff of the
        Casino
        
        1.  Such additional rules or requirements SHALL NOT be held to
            invalidate, override or overrule these Terms of Membership.
    
    3.  These Terms of Membership MAY change when it is deemed necessary
        by the Staff
    
    4.  The Staff will attempt, to the best of their ability, to notify
        you of any changes to this contract: this, however, is not
        guaranteed, you MAY NOT be notified of these changes – it is
        your responsibility to ensure you understand the latest contract
        terms.
    
    5.  By continuing to play or be present after changes or revisions
        are made, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
    
    6.  Any contract change MUST be presented first to all Staff of the
        Casino; it MUST then either: Be manually approved by the Owner
        or have a period of 60 hours before the contract is
        automatically approved. After either of those conditions, the
        Contract becomes valid.
    
    7.  Even if some part of this contract is, for any reason, made to
        be invalid or unenforceable, all other sections of this contract
        will still be enforced and will still be considered valid.

3.  This Casino withholds the authority, through the M.O.A., to punish
    and penalise players for violations of this contract.
    
    8.  Any Staff member MAY recommend the MOA to investigate a member
        for punishment
    
    9.  Further powers granted to the MOA MAY be found in its section.

4.  Cheating is strictly forbidden. Members MUST NOT rig or cheat games.

5.  **It is forbidden to aid in; fail to report the; or partake in the
    exchange of chips for real-world currency. It is similarly forbidden
    to exchange chips with any persons that are not a subject of this
    Terms of Membership contract.** *Termination CAN occur for violation
    of this rule.*

6.  All chips have the following value – these values SHALL NOT be
    changed without contract update:
    
    10. **White:** 25
    
    11. **Red:** 50
    
    12. **Green:** 100
    
    13. **Blue:** 500
    
    14. **Black:** 1000

7.  This Contract’s terms SHALL be interpreted as literally as possible;
    in a case where it is unclear what is meant, it is up to The Council
    to determine the true meaning of a clause within this contract which
    would, therefore, be considered its true meaning.

8.  Throughout this Contract, at any point where ‘the Council’,
    ‘Council’, ‘the Staff’ or ‘Staff’ is used in such a way to give
    authority to such group, it is to be assumed (unless stated
    otherwise) that such an authority is given on condition of a
    majority verdict.

9.  Members MUST act in good faith, to the best of their ability, to
    ensure this contract is followed.

10. Members SHOULD inform the dealer of any mistakes or oversights.

11. The Casino SHALL aim to be more open in its decisions and changes.

12. **The chips used within the Casino have
    *<span class="underline">no</span>* real-world value.**

## II: Termination of Membership

1.  This contract MAY be terminated by either the person that has signed
    it; or the Staff as outlined in situations where a violation of
    contract occurred, as described below:
    
    1.  A Member MAY request themselves be terminated by giving a
        written notice via the Four Aces official Discord™ server. The
        Council SHALL then terminate the Member.
    
    2.  A Member MAY also be terminated for violations or breaches of
        this Contract, or the Staff contract, within sections of these
        Terms.
    
    3.  A Member MAY also be terminated for violations of Coundon
        Court’s policies.
    
    4.  A Member MAY also be terminated for violations of applicable UK
        law.
    
    5.  Pursuant to *<span class="underline">\[b\]</span>*, a Member MAY
        be terminated for severe breaches of contract, in which case a
        specific authorisation from a clause within the Terms is not
        needed, and only a unanimous agreement decision by The Council
        is needed.

2.  In the scenario of a Termination of Membership, the follow SHALL
    apply:
    
    6.  The Member MUST hand over any chips that they have, or have
        access to, to the Casino.
    
    7.  The Member will be revoked access to certain channels within the
        official Discord server.
    
    8.  Any Terminated Member SHALL NOT interfere with the running or
        games of the Casino.
    
    9.  A Terminated Member MUST still abide by these Terms of Contract

    10. Pursuant to *<span class="underline">\[d\]</span>*, any
        Terminated Member that remains on Casino grounds (within the

    11. If a Terminated Member leaves the Casino completely and
        entirely, they are no longer required to abide by these Terms to
        any effect
    
    12. Pursuant to *<span class="underline">\[f\]</span>*, *completely
        and entirely*, is defined as having left and not returned to the
        Casino for a period of no less than six (6) weeks.

## III: Chip Ownership

1.  All chips used are owned by Troy Smitten, and SHALL NOT be lost,
    damaged, destroyed, exchanged, given or otherwise transferred except
    as allowed through the Casino’s operations or through explicit
    consent of Mr Smitten.

2.  All Chips are leased ownership to the Casino. The Casino has supreme
    authority on any chips where they are involved in the Casino’s
    operations. An exception is given where there are reasonable
    requirements that Troy Smitten have the final say on the chip(s) in
    question.

3.  Chips MUST NOT be possessed by any person that has not agreed to
    this Contract. Any person that attempts to do so MUST first agree to
    this Contract and its Terms, fully and completely to the extent
    necessary to protect the Casino, its operations, and the chips.

4.  In the scenario of play, a Member MAY allow another individual to
    possess or otherwise hold their chips. In this case, the Member
    SHALL first disclose to The Council exactly how many, and which
    type, of chips, are to be held by this Member.
    
    1.  In the circumstance where The Council is not informed, the
        Casino takes zero responsibilities and offers no assistance or
        insurance on those chips – The Council MAY consider such chips
        to be in the possession of whoever indeed possesses them, even
        if an agreement was made (but of course, was not disclosed to
        The Council)

## IV: Privacy and Data Policy

1.  The Four Aces Casino records the following information (but not
    necessarily only the listed) of all members, stored for an
    as-of-currently indefinite period of time:
    
    1.  Member’s Name
    
    2.  Member’s Discord Information
    
    3.  Information within the Casino:
        
        1.  Member’s count of chips (per week, via audits)

        3.  Member’s number of awards, their type and reasons.
        
        4.  Member’s loans, and all information required for handling
            such loans.

2.  The Casino’s discord bot additionally records all messages that are
    sent within the Casino’s discord server and to the bot’s private
    messages.
    
    4.  These message logs are only visible to the Bot’s owner, Alex.
    
    5.  These messages will not be deleted, but a Member MAY request to
        see all logs the bot has that the member has sent. (through an
        FOI/Freedom of Information request)
    
    6.  This request MUST be answered to within 5 (five) working days of
        the request initially being sent.
    
    7.  The request MAY be rejected, but only for:
        
        5.  Reasons as outlined as per the Freedom of Information
            Act\[1\]
        
        6.  In the case of cost-related exemptions, or other exemptions
            that would not make sense given the scale of the Casino,
            such exemption limits or requirements are to be reduced to a
            reasonable limit.
    
    8.  The request MAY be redacted, but only information that is:
        
        7.  Not relevant to the request;
        
        8.  Outside the scope of the request;
        
        9.  Otherwise private; or
        
        10. Not from the person themselves
    
    9.  Any member MAY request an FOI request for any logs, but
        redactions will apply as per above.
    
    10. Additionally, if the request is especially large or
        time-consuming, an extension MAY be given such that the request
        is answered within the time as per
        *<span class="underline">\[c\]</span>* but delivered at a later
        date, within a reasonable time period of no more than 5
        additional days.
        
        1.  
## V: Poker

1.  Poker buy-ins are 25 chips.

2.  A player MAY raise by any amount they wish, so long as they have the
    chips required to do so.
    
    1.  **The Casino MAY enforce a ‘table stake’ standard; a player MAY
        NOT bring any new or additional chips to the table after their
        cards have been distributed by the dealer. **

3.  A player MAY only remove chips from the pot with any Staff member’s
    approval, and only in situations that would require it, and where it
    would not be unfair to other players.

4.  A player MAY fold at any time. When a player folds, they are no
    longer able to bet and MUST return their cards to the dealer. A
    player that has folded MUST remain folded until the end of the
    match. An exception CAN be made by consensus of Management, but only
    when the next player has not bet yet.

5.  A player MAY go all in once betting starts. After an all-in, a
    showdown is immediately done
    
    2.  If only two players go all-in, then the lowest all-in bet is
        matched by the player with more chips, and any excess that
        player has is returned.
    
    3.  If more than two players are present, but the all in bet only
        constitutes no more than 300 chips or is no more than ¼ of the
        pot at that point, then (just 1 player goes all in):
        
        1.  The remaining players continue to play as per normal to the
            remaining rounds.
        
        2.  Once all the rounds have been completed and all five cards
            have been placed and the final round has been performed,
            each of the players’ hands is looked at to see who wins
        
        3.  Any member MAY win the main pot: whichever member has the
            highest hand MAY win the main pot
        
        4.  For the side pot (constituting any additionally bets the
            non-all in players MAY have made after the all-in was made),
            only the members that continued betting (i.e.: not the
            all-in player) MAY win the pot; the player with the best
            hand in the pot will win it.
    
    4.  If more than two players are present, and
        *<span class="underline">\[b\]</span>* does not apply, then:
        
        5.  For all players going all-in until only one has chips
            remaining:
        
        6.  The lowest all in bet gets matched by all players and gets
            placed in a pot that those players could win (the first
            all-in bet is matched by everyone and thus is placed inside
            the ‘main pot’ – with other rounds’ chips)
        
        7.  Then, the next lowest bet is matched by the remaining
            players with chips in another, separate, pot that could only
            be won by the players still in.
        
        8.  This continues until only one player has any chips
            remaining, in which case they MAY keep any chips they have.
        
        9.  Once all players have bet, additional cards are drawn until
            there are 5 community cards, at which point:
        
        10. Any player MAY win the main pot (including the first lowest
            all in bets)
        
        11. Only players who have matched a side-pot MAY win that side
            pot.
    
    5.  These bets ***MUST*** be kept in separate places, with the ‘main
        pot’ all in bet being placed closest to the dealer, and each
        subsequent being placed *clearly separate* away from the dealer.

6.  A player MAY bet once all players have paid the buy-in, have all
    their cards, and the first 3 cards are placed down. A player MAY
    call a previous player’s bet and match it with their own chips if
    there are less than five cards on the table. A player MAY raise
    another player’s bet, matching it and then betting higher than the
    previous bet. A player MAY also check, but only where there is no
    previous bet – this means that they do not raise.

7.  A player is never unable to bet – if they do not have the required
    amount to match a previous bet, they MAY go all in and the above all
    in rules will be used.

8.  When there are five cards on the table, players MAY continue betting
    and folding. If all players decide to check after the river, then
    the game is finished, and the players MUST show their hands.

9.  Any action to raise, fold, check, call, etc SHOULD be vocalised: the
    player SHOULD clearly announce their intentions – the dealer MAY
    accept a ‘knocking’ on the table to signify a check but MAY request
    clarification if they deem an action to be ambiguous.

10. A player’s first action is accepted and CANNOT be changed (for
    example if a player says that they check, then say that they raise,
    the action of checking is accepted only.)

11. The Dealer MAY decide to call to a close betting when there are five
    cards. The game will finish, with players showing their cards.

12. The Staff of the Casino make the ultimate, unanimous, decision
    regarding which player had the strongest hand and has thus won.

13. Typical Poker rules apply.
    
    6.  *Typical Poker rules* are defined as rules where it is
        demonstrated they are in use across multiple independent
        Casinos.
    
    7.  These rules CANNOT be found to invalidate this contract or its
        terms.
    
    8.  These rules MAY be invalidated by Management, with consensus.

14. Members SHOULD NOT collaborate with other Member’s in a manner which
    presents an unfair advantage, for example, by showing each other
    their hands or otherwise acting outside of what would be considered
    normal etiquette

### VI: Poker Stars / Coundon Coins

Poker Stars (also known as Coundon Coins) have been revised such that:

  - Any member MAY hand in 1 Coundon Coin in exchange for 3000 chips.

  - Coundon Coins SHALL NOT be exchanged for chips; Coundon coins are no
    longer given a return value, as they are no longer designed to be
    returned.

These revisions *MAY* be altered by Management, such that Poker Stars
MAY be returned in exchange for chips – but only in circumstances where
it is fair and deemed necessary, by consensus of Management.

### VII: Poker Rake

1.  The Casino has the authority to enforce a rake within any poker game
    in the Casino.

2.  Rakes are a scaled commission fee, taken to support the wages, staff
    and costs incurred by running this Casino.

3.  The rake is set only by the following sections below. The rake is
    taken into the Casino’s vault at the end of all rounds of a poker
    game.
    
    1.  The rake SHALL NOT be altered, increased or changed except for
        the levels and conditions set about below or elsewhere in these
        Terms.
    
    2.  The rake is set to 5% for all Members.
    
    3.  For Members in the VIP club, the rake applies at 5% the first
        week, then every following week is deducted by 0.5% until they
        have no rake at all.
        
        1.  The Casino may still enforce a minimum of 25 chips, even if
            the rake is 0%
        
        2.  In the case where there are more than 3000 chips that are
            being won, the rake is set at 5%.

## VIII: Blackjack

1.  The player MAY bet any reasonable amount, with a minimum of 50, and
    no more than 1000
    
    1.  Diminishing returns applies on any additional winnings above the
        first 500 chips.
    
    2.  For each chip won above the first 500 (ie, 525 to 1000), the
        chip is worth half as much (ie, 50 -\> 25)
    
    3.  For each chip won over 1000 chips in winnings, the chip is worth
        only 25% as much (ie, 100 -\> 25)

2.  If a player receives two cards of the same value, they MAY split
    their cards into two hands.
    
    1.  The player MUST then match their current bet for their
        additional hand
    
    2.  Each hand is then considered independent to the other, and any
        action (ie win or bust) to one hand is not considered to the
        other. In other words, the hands are completely separate –
        splitting doubles your chances of winning, but also doubles your
        chances of losing.
    
    3.  The player receives a face-up card to their left hand and a
        face-down card to their right hand
    
    4.  The player continues to play as per normal, but MUST start with
        their left hand, then continue to their right. They cannot
        return to their left hand once stuck, won or lost.
    
    5.  If the player splits on Aces, then they cannot hit or double –
        they must take only one card for each and are stuck with those
        hands.

3.  The player MAY decide to double-down their hand if they have not yet
    hit.

<!-- end list -->

1.  The player MUST double their current bet, and take only one
    additional card

2.  The player CANNOT hit again and MUST either stick with what they
    have or go bust if they go over 21

<!-- end list -->

4.  The player MAY decide to surrender their hand only when they have
    not yet hit.
    
    4.  The player takes back half of their bet, and the other half goes
        to the Casino

5.  Once a player wins, the dealer will match their bet and the player
    will receive this amount.

6.  If a player (or the dealer) immediately gets 21 with only two cards
    (their first two cards) (this is called a *‘natural’* or
    *‘blackjack’*) (i.e., an ace and any ‘ten-card’), the following
    conditions apply:

<!-- end list -->

1.  If any player gets a natural, and the dealer does not, the dealer
    immediately matches the players’ bets, to a return rate of 3:2, and
    gives them this amount.

2.  If the dealer has a natural, he immediately takes the bets of all
    players that do not have a natural.

3.  The dealer MAY look at their face-down card if their face-up card
    would allow a natural (i.e. an ace or a ten-card)

<!-- end list -->

7.  If the Dealer’s face up card is an Ace, any player MAY place
    *Insurance.*

<!-- end list -->

1.  Insurance is a separate wager that the Dealer has blackjack and is
    kept separate from the player’s main bet and is a maximum of double
    their initial bet.

2.  If the dealer’s second (face-down) card is not a ten-card, then
    players lose the amount that they insured.

3.  If the dealer’s second (face-down) card is any ten-card then the
    players that have paid insurance receive their insurance bets in a
    1:1 return rate (ie, if they bet 50, they receive 50). All players
    would still lose their initial bet.

<!-- end list -->

8.  All players play against the Dealer, if they get a higher amount
    than the Dealer, their bet is matched. The game continues for each
    player until all players have either stuck or folded; at that point,
    the Dealer hits themselves until they either win, are forced to
    stick or bust.
    
    5.  For instances where the player(s) or Dealer gets a blackjack
        (Ace + Ten card), then see above.

9.  The Dealer shall, once all other players have finalised their hands,
    continue to hit with their hand until they either go bust or reach a
    value of 17 or greater.

10. Players may only split or double if they have not yet done any other
    action

11. The Staff make the ultimate decision of who, and how much, has been
    won.

    8.  Members MUST first be issued two “No penalty” warning citations
        before a fine MAY be given.
        
        4.  This requirement MAY be waived by the M.O.A. Inspector (or,
            in case of recusal, a majority verdict by Casino Management)
        
        5.  This requirement is automatically waived for major
            violations of this Contract, for example (but not limited
            to) exchanging chips for real-world values; or for any other
            action that would otherwise result in a termination.
    
    9.  Fines MUST be fair and proportional to the infraction at hand.

        are applicable to have their Membership Terminated

5.  The M.O.A. additionally withholds the sole authority to issue Awards
    
    11. Awards are either:
        
        6.  Presence
        
        7.  Suffience
        
        8.  Excellence
    
    12. Awards are granted by having no Citations over a certain period,
        determined by the M.O.A. Inspector; or granted for other
        behaviour worthy of an award.
    
    13. Awards MAY have certain benefits, for example (but not

    judgement or decisions will be issued by the Inspector.
    
    1.  Investigations MAY also be started by the M.O.G. Supervisor, and
        any final judgement in that cases will be issued by that
        Supervisor.

3.  Investigations will be directed by a Lead Investigator.
    
    2.  This Lead Investigator is appointed by the MOA Inspector and MAY
        be replaced or removed at any time, but only for a conflict of
        interest or serious conduct unbecoming.
    
    3.  This Lead Investigator MUST be a member of the MOA, or MOG if
        for an Audit investigation
    
    4.  This Lead Investigator reports directly to the MOA Inspector in
        their findings. Lead Investigators have the authority to request
        citations to those the investigation finds to be in violation;

        Inspector.

    investigation and recommend any actions that are to be taken.

8.  Investigations are still under the purview of the MOA Inspector: any
    investigator or lead investigator MAY be removed or appointed by the
    MOA Inspector, though a reason for removal MUST be given if
    requested by the Lead Investigator, or another Division Head

9.  Failure to comply with an Investigator, Lead Investigator or the
    Investigation, in general, is failing to comply with the MOA. Lead

    outcome of an investigation to Casino Management – though
    information SHOULD be redacted to ensure confidentiality.
    (redactions MUST follow the same rules as per section **IV: Privacy
    and Data Policy**)

11. The MOA, via Investigations, will decide the outcome of any dispute

        payment of the loan. Discretion is given such that Management
        MAY decide if they are to remove chips.

11. A Member MAY wish to use another player as a guarantee: if the
    initial loaned member fails to repay the loan, then the guarantee
    member’s chips are used to cover the loan.

    consent of Mr Smitten.

16. All Chips are leased ownership to the Casino. The Casino has supreme
    authority on any chips where they are involved in the Casino’s
    operations. An exception is given where there are reasonable
    requirements that Troy Smitten have the final say on the chip(s) in
    question.

17. Chips may not be possessed by any person that has not agreed to this
    Contract. Any person that attempts to do so must first agree to this

    first disclose to Management exactly how many, and which type, of
    chips are to be held by this Member.
    
    26. In the circumstance where Management is not informed, the Casino
        takes zero responsibilities and offers no assistance or
        insurance on those chips – Management may consider such chips to
        be in the possession of whoever indeed possesses them, even if
        an agreement was made (but of course, was not disclosed to
        Management)

## Privacy and Data Policy

    28. Member’s Discord Information

    messages.
    
    30. These message logs are only visible to the Bot’s owner, Alex.
    
    31. These messages will not be deleted, but a Member may request to
        see all logs the bot has that the member has sent. This request
        will be honoured to the best of Alex’s ability, and will be
        performed in a reasonably timed period.

## Poker

21. Poker buy-ins are 25 chips.

22. A player may raise by any amount they wish, so long as they have the
    chips required to do so.
    
    32. **The Casino shall enforce a ‘table stake’ standard; a player
        may not bring any new or additional chips to the table after
        their cards have been distributed by the dealer. **

23. A player may only remove chips from the pot with any Staff member’s
    approval, and only in situations that would require it, and where it
    would not be unfair to other players.

24. A player may fold at any time. When a player folds, they are no
    longer able to bet and must return their cards to the dealer. A
    player that has folded must remain folded until the end of the
    match. An exception can be made by consensus of Management, but only
    when the next player has not bet yet.

25. A player may go all in once betting starts. After an all-in, a
    showdown is immediately done
    
    33. If only two players go all-in, then the lowest all-in bet is
        matched by the player with more chips, and any excess that
        player has is returned.
    
    34. If more than two players are present, the following applies
        after one goes all-in:
        
        5.  If the lowest all-in bet is no more than either 250, or ¼ of
            the total main pot’s value, then the below applies. Else,
            previous rules apply.
        
        6.  The remaining players continue to play as per normal to the
            remaining rounds.
        
        7.  Once all the rounds have been completed and all five cards
            have been placed and the final round has been performed,
            each of the players’ hands is looked at to see who wins
        
        8.  Any member may win the main pot: whichever member has the
            highest hand may win the main pot
        
        9.  For the side pot, only the members that continued betting
            (ie: not the all-in player) may win the pot; it is the
            player that gains the highest amount who wins this pot.
    
    35. These bets ***must*** be kept in separate places, with the ‘main
        pot’ all in bet being placed closest to the dealer, and each
        subsequent being placed *clearly separate* away from the dealer.

26. A player may bet once all players have paid the buy-in, have all
    their cards, and the first 3 cards are placed down. A player may
    call a previous player’s bet, and match it with their own chips, if
    there are less than five cards on the table. A player may raise
    another player’s bet, matching it and then betting higher than the
    previous bet. A player may also check, but only where there is no
    previous bet – this means that they do not raise.

27. A player is never unable to bet – if they do not have the required
    amount to match a previous bet, they may decide to go all in and the
    above all in rules will be used.

28. When there are five cards on the table, players may continue betting
    and folding. If all players decide to call the current bet, then the
    game is finished, and the players must show their hands.

29. Any action to raise, fold, check, call, etc must be vocalised: the
    player must clearly announce their intentions – the dealer may
    accept a ‘knocking’ on the table to signify a check but may request
    clarification if they deem an action to be ambiguous.

30. A player’s first action is accepted and cannot be changed: if a
    player says that they check, then say that they raise, the action of
    checking is accepted only.

31. The Dealer may decide to call to a close betting when there are five
    cards. The game will finish, with players showing their cards.

32. The Staff of the Casino make the ultimate, unanimous, decision
    regarding which player had the strongest hand and has thus won.

33. Typical Poker rules apply.
    
    36. *Typical Poker rules* are defined as rules where it can be
        demonstrated they are in use across multiple independent
        Casinos.
    
    37. These rules cannot be found to invalidate this contract or its
        terms.
    
    38. These rules may be invalidated by Management, with consensus.

### Poker Stars / Coundon Coins

Poker Stars (also known as Coundon Coins) have been revised such that:

  - Any member may hand in 1 Coundon Coin in exchange for 3000 chips.

  - No members can exchange chips for Coundon coins; Coundon coins are
    no longer given a return value, as they are no longer designed to be
    returned.

These revisions *may* be altered by Management, such that Poker Stars
may be returned in exchange for chips – but only in circumstances where
it is fair and deemed necessary, by consensus of Management.

### Poker Rake

34. The Casino has the authority to enforce a rake within any poker game
    in the Casino.

35. Rakes are a scaled commission fee, taken to support the wages, staff
    and costs incurred by running this Casino.

36. The rake is set to the main discretion of the Dealer, following
    order of seniority of Staff – with exceptions under cases of
    mandatory recusals if the rake applies to the Staff member. The rake
    is taken into the Casino’s vault at the end of all rounds of a poker
    game.
    
    39. The rake may not be altered, increased or changed except for the
        levels and conditions set about below or elsewhere in these
        Terms.
    
    40. Under normal conditions, the rake is set to 10%
    
    41. When applied against a staff member, the rake is set to 7.5%
    
    42. When applied against a Management member, the rake is set to 5%
    
    43. The rake may be altered by other clauses within these Terms.
    
    44. In the case of any player going all-in, the rake is set to 15%.
    
    45. The Casino may take a minimum rake of 25 chips, regardless of
        any rounding of any percentages. Whether or not the rake is
        round is left to the discretion of the Casino, following
        standard recusal procedures.

## Blackjack

37. The player may bet any reasonable amount, with a minimum of 50, and
    no more than 1000

38. If a player receives two cards of the same value, they may split
    their cards into two hands.
    
    1.  The player must then match their current bet for their
        additional hand
    
    2.  The player may win with either, or both, of their hands
    
    3.  The player does not immediately lose if one hand is bust
    
    4.  The player may stick with either, or both, of their hands
    
    5.  The player must be dealt two more cards for each hand – the new
        card is placed face-up for the left hand, but face-down for the
        right hand.
    
    6.  The player must first start hitting on their left hand. Once
        they have stuck or gone bust on that hand, they must then move
        to their right hand, at which point they may then look at the
        face-down card.
    
    7.  The player may not start hitting again on their first hand once
        they have moved to their second.

39. The player may decide to double-down their hand if they have not yet
    hit.

<!-- end list -->

1.  The player must double their current bet, and take only one
    additional card

2.  The player cannot hit again and must either stick with what they
    have or go bust should they go over 21

<!-- end list -->

40. The player may decide to surrender their hand only when they have
    not yet hit.
    
    46. The player takes back half of their bet, and the other half goes
        to the dealer

41. Once a player wins, the dealer will match their bet and the player
    will receive this amount.

42. If a player (or the dealer) immediately gets 21 with only two cards
    (this is called a *‘natural’* or *‘blackjack’*) (i.e., an ace and
    any ‘ten-card’), the following conditions apply:

<!-- end list -->

1.  If any player gets a natural, and the dealer does not, the dealer
    immediately matches the players’ bets and gives them this amount.

2.  If the dealer has a natural, he immediately takes the bets of all
    players that do not have a natural.

3.  The dealer may look at their face-down card if their face-up card
    would allow a natural (i.e. an ace or a ten-card)

<!-- end list -->

43. If the Dealer’s face up card is an Ace, any player may place
    *Insurance.*

<!-- end list -->

1.  Insurance is kept separate from the player’s main bet and is a
    maximum bet of half of their main bet.

2.  If the dealer’s second (face-down) card is not a ten-card, then
    players lose the amount that they insured.

3.  If the dealer’s second (face-down) card is any ten-card then the
    players that have paid insurance do not lose either of their bets.

<!-- end list -->

44. All players play against the Dealer, if they get a higher amount
    than the Dealer, their bet is matched. The game continues for each
    player until all players have either stuck or folded; at that point,
    the Dealer hits themselves until they either win, are forced to
    stick or bust.
    
    47. For instances where the player(s) or Dealer gets a blackjack
        (Ace + Ten card), then see above.

45. The Staff make the ultimate decision of who, and how much, has been
    won.

        kept until a clear winner has been decided.
    
    62. When a winner has been decided by the M.O.A., those winnings
        previously seized shall be handed over to the Member who won.

56. Failure to cooperate with the M.O.A. is punishable by citation or
    termination, where applicable, and to the discretion of the M.O.A.
    
    63. In the instance of a termination, Management must also agree to
        a majority verdict.

## M.O.A. Investigations

57. The Ministry of Admissions has the authority to launch
    investigations or inquires to find the truth or come to a conclusion
    on a given subject.

58. Investigations may only be started by the M.O.A. Inspector, and any
    final judgement or decisions will be issued by the Inspector.

59. Investigations will be directed by a Lead Investigator.
    
    64. This Lead Investigator is appointed by the MOA Inspector and may
        be replaced or removed at any time, for any reason.
    
    65. This Lead Investigator must be a member of the MOA
    
    66. This Lead Investigator reports directly to the MOA Inspector in
        their findings. Lead Investigators have the authority to request
        citations to those the investigation finds to be in violation;
        such citations would be confirmed and issued by the MOA
        Inspector.

60. Lead Investigators may appoint or remove further Investigators to
    help them in their duties

61. (Lead) Investigators may resign from their position within an
    investigation at any point.

62. Any Investigator has the authority to begin an interview with any
    Member of the Casino.
    
    67. These Interviews are considered confidential and their clearance
        may only be changed by a person with such authority to do so.
    
    68. These interviews may be locked and archived when they are
        concluded
    
    69. These interviews may have certain information released, via the
        MOA Archives, to the discretion of the MOA Inspector.

63. The Lead Investigator may, to their discretion, conclude that an
    investigation has been finished; when this is the case, they may
    close the investigation, deleting it. Before doing so, the Lead
    Investigator must inform the MOA Inspector of the outcome of the
    investigation and recommend any actions that should be taken.

64. Investigations are still under the purview of the MOA Inspector: any
    investigator or lead investigator may be removed or appointed by the
    MOA Inspector, though a reason for removal must be given if
    requested by the Lead Investigator.

65. Failure to comply with an Investigator, Lead Investigator or the
    Investigation in general is failing to comply with the MOA. Lead
    Investigators have the authority to request citations or punishment
    through the MOA Inspector to those that any uncooperative.

66. The MOA Inspector is required, when requested, to disclose the
    outcome of an investigation to Casino Management – though
    information may be redacted to ensure confidentiality.

67. The MOA, via Investigations, will decide the outcome of any dispute
    of who wins – though in this very limited case, it acts as a
    recommendation to Casino Management.

# Ministry of Loans

68. ![](media/image2.png)The Ministry of Loans (M.O.L.) is the authority
    that will handle all things regarding loans within the Casino.

69. The M.O.L. is a department ran directly by Management of the Casino
    and thus has no official supervisor.

70. The M.O.L. shall issue loans that have a set interest.
    
    70. This interest is added on every day after the loan is taken

71. The M.O.L. shall issues loans that have a set maximum date before
    which the loan and any additional value must be returned.
    
    71. Defaulting on your loan payments may have consequences, as
        determined by the Ministry. This Ministry shall also work
        closely with the M.O.A.

72. The M.O.L. shall issues loans that have a minimum daily payment that
    must be made.
    
    72. This payment **must** be made at the end of each lunch on each
        *week*day
    
    73. Failure to keep up with these daily payments *will* have
        consequences

73. Upon immediately receiving any loan of value, the amount needed to
    repay is increased by 10% of the original loan amount. (500 -\> 550,
    2500 -\> 2750, etc)

74. The maximum amount a player may return each day shall be no more
    than 20% of the original loan value (including immediate interest).

75. The M.O.L. has the authority to issue the following loans:
    
    74. *Because the information on loans may change to the discretion
        of the M.O.L., loan information may be requested by them (one
        could also use **/loans request** discord command to see the
        loans available)*

76. The M.O.L. has the authority to tax the winnings of a game when it
    is a player with a loan that wins. This tax can be no more than 25%
    of the player’s winnings.

77. To ensure the Casino is repaid the loans it gives, the Casino may:
    
    75. Remove the chips placed into the pot by a person with a loan
        when that pot is won by anyone other than the person with that
        loan; but only when the chips removed do not exceed 100, and do
        not exceed 10% of the pot value, and do not exceed the minimum
        daily payment required against the loan.
    
    76. Directly remove chips from a person with a loan at the end of
        the day’s sitting to a value not exceeding the minimum daily
        payment of the loan. Discretion is given such that Management
        may decide if they are to remove chips.

78. A Member may wish to use another player as a guarantee: if the
    initial loaned member fails to repay the loan, then the guarantee
    member’s chips are used to cover the loan.
    
    77. The M.O.L. may seize this guarantee’s member’s chips to cover
        the minimal chip payment, or to seize payment in full.
    
    78. The M.O.L. may not seize in total more than the initial chip
        value that was given by the Casino at the start of the loan

# Other Additional Rules

## Lottery

79. The Casino, in good faith, may hold lotteries that involve the
    following:
    
    79. Each player puts in any amount they deem.
    
    80. Each player receives two cards, and five cards are placed on the
        table.
    
    81. The player with the highest/winning hand wins the lottery pot.
    
    82. If multiple players have the same best 5 cards, then the lottery
        is split between them.

## VIP Club

80. The VIP Club is a Management-sponsored group of members that receive
    additional benefits and opportunities that non-club members would
    otherwise not be given.

81. Club members will have to pay a 100-chip membership fee directly
    into the Casino each week
    
    83. After a consistent membership to the VIP Club of 3 weeks, a
        Member shall only have to pay 50 chips per week

82. Club members are given an additional two games grace as described
    below

83. Club members rake is reduced depending on the number of weeks they
    have been a member.
    
    84. The first week a Member is a VIP, their rake is 7.5%
    
    85. Each subsequent week their rake is decreased by 0.5%, to a
        minimum of 5%.

84. Clubs member will be given benefits in any future games that the
    Casino introduce – they may also be given exclusive inclusion into
    some games.

85. Members may request to join the VIP Club by asking Management, who
    will then decide with a majority vote on whether the member is given
    Membership.

86. After joining the club, a one-time, up-front, payment of 200 chips
    must be given to the Casino.

87. The ‘High Roller’ for each week is automatically permitted free
    membership of the VIP Club for the following week.

## High Stakes Poker Games

1.  High stakes poker games are normal poker games as explained above
    with a few changes:
    
    1.  The starting bet is 50 chips; (if any,) bets on the flop must be
        no lower than 75
    
    2.  The minimum bet is one and a half of the previous round’s bet.
        (ex: if the last round was raised by 100 (and matched by all)
        then the next round must start at 150 – rounded up where ever
        needed)

## Fees for not playing

For each game that is missed, a player will be given 50 chips-worth in a
penalty. This penalty will be allowed a ‘grace’ period, of three games,
per week. If the player does not exceed a missed-game count of three per
week, then their count is reset on the next week. If the player does
exceed three games per week, they shall be fined a cumulative penalty.
As shown:

  - On the third game missed, the penalty is at 150 chips and is the
    final allowed missed game. (the penalty would not, at this point, be
    deducted)

  - On the fourth game missed, the penalty is deducted at 200 chips.

  - On the fifth game missed, the penalty is deducted at 250 chips.

  - On the sixth game missed, the penalty is deducted at 300 chips.

  - On the seventh game missed, the penalty is deducted at 350 chips.

  - On the eighth game missed, the penalty is deducted at 400 chips.

And so on.

Repeated, deliberate, missing of games may result in a further penalty
or termination of Membership – even if the Member does not exceed the
three-time grace period.

## Departments / Divisions

  - **Ministry of Admissions**
    
      - **M.O.A.** staff members MUST be Members of the Casino and are
        appointed by the Division Head; their objective is to ensure
        that the M.O.A. makes valid and just decisions. They report any
        contractual oversights or infringements to the M.O.A. Inspector
        and advise that Inspector and Management on new Memberships.
    
      - **M.O.A. Inspector** supervises the M.O.A. and officially hands
        citations and awards, with advice from M.O.A. staff. The M.O.A.
        Inspector will receive requests for citations from any
        Investigation that is opened, in such a case, the MOA Inspector
        SHOULD make a fair and valid decision given probable cause that
        an incident violated the terms.

  - **Ministry of Loans**
    
      - **M.O.L.** staff members MAY be any Member of the Casino. They
        MAY: recommend the best loan to Members that are looking to get
        one; advertise loans to Members, within reason; and give
        recommendations to Management on who is to be given a loan,
        given a personal assessment of that person’s finance.
    
      - **M.O.L.** **Division Head** supervises the M.O.L. and presents
        any possible loans to Management for approval.

  - **Ministry of Games**
    
      - **M.O.G.** staff members assist in the day-to-day running of
        games; the proper auditing of chips within the Casino; and the
        recording of games missed by members. The M.O.G. MUST work
        closely with the M.O.A. due to the nature of possible punishment
        against Members.
    
      - **M.O.G. Division Head** supervises all actions of the M.O.G.
        and has the authority to directly issue citations related to the
        M.O.G.’s authority.

Each of these divisions has a Division Head (or MOA Inspector), this
Division Head is responsible for the entirety of the
Department/Division. This Division Head has the ultimate authority of
that Division. Each Division Head is employed to the pleasure of the
Owner and MUST take into consideration the Owner’s advice or wishes in a
situation within the Divisions purview. Additionally, these Division
Heads MAY appoint other Members to positions within their Division and
delegate tasks and duties to those Members; any such Member MUST NOT
abuse such positions.

The Division Heads MAY also seek the advice of the Casino Owner in cases
where such advice is needed.

Additionally, henceforth, a Council is established that consists of the
Division Heads of all Ministries, and the Owner. This Council will have
the authority to make decisions that span numerous departments’
authorities, or that would impact the entirety of the Casino as a whole,
or a decision that would be outside the purview of any singular
department.

    consent of Mr Smitten.

2.  All Chips are leased ownership to the Casino. The Casino has supreme

    1.  In the circumstance where Management is not informed, the Casino
        takes zero responsibilities and offers no assistance or
        insurance on those chips – Management MAY consider such chips to

        FOI/Freedom of Information request)
    
    6.  This request MUST be answered to within 5 (five) working days of
        the request initially being sent.
    
    7.  The request MAY be rejected, but only for:

        date, within a reasonable time period of no more than 5
        additional days.
        
        1.  
## V: Poker

1.  Poker buy-ins are 25 chips.

2.  A player MAY raise by any amount they wish, so long as they have the
    chips required to do so.
    
    1.  **The Casino MAY enforce a ‘table stake’ standard; a player MAY
        NOT bring any new or additional chips to the table after their
        cards have been distributed by the dealer. **

3.  A player MAY only remove chips from the pot with any Staff member’s
    approval, and only in situations that would require it, and where it
    would not be unfair to other players.

4.  A player MAY fold at any time. When a player folds, they are no
    longer able to bet and MUST return their cards to the dealer. A
    player that has folded MUST remain folded until the end of the
    match. An exception CAN be made by consensus of Management, but only
    when the next player has not bet yet.

5.  A player MAY go all in once betting starts. After an all-in, a
    showdown is immediately done
    
    2.  If only two players go all-in, then the lowest all-in bet is
        matched by the player with more chips, and any excess that
        player has is returned.
    
    3.  If more than two players are present, but the all in bet only
        constitutes no more than 300 chips, or is no more than ¼ of the
        pot at that point, then (just 1 player goes all in):
        
        1.  The remaining players continue to play as per normal to the
            remaining rounds.
        
        2.  Once all the rounds have been completed and all five cards
            have been placed and the final round has been performed,
            each of the players’ hands is looked at to see who wins
        
        3.  Any member MAY win the main pot: whichever member has the
            highest hand MAY win the main pot
        
        4.  For the side pot (constituting any additionally bets the
            non-all in players MAY have made after the all-in was made),
            only the members that continued betting (i.e.: not the
            all-in player) MAY win the pot; the player with the best
            hand in the pot will win it.
    
    4.  If more than two players are present, and
        *<span class="underline">\[b\]</span>* does not apply, then:
        
        5.  For all players going all-in until only one has chips
            remaining:
        
        6.  The lowest all in bet gets matched by all players and gets
            placed in a pot that those players could win (the first
            all-in bet is matched by everyone and thus is placed inside
            the ‘main pot’ – with other rounds’ chips)
        
        7.  Then, the next lowest bet is matched by the remaining
            players with chips in another, separate pot that could only
            be won by the players still in.
        
        8.  This continues until only one player has any chips
            remaining, in which case they MAY keep any chips they have.
        
        9.  Once all players have bet, additional cards are drawn until
            there are 5 community cards, at which point:
        
        10. Any player MAY win the main pot (including the first lowest
            all in bets)
        
        11. Only players who have matched a side-pot MAY win that side
            pot.
    
    5.  These bets ***MUST*** be kept in separate places, with the ‘main
        pot’ all in bet being placed closest to the dealer, and each
        subsequent being placed *clearly separate* away from the dealer.

6.  A player MAY bet once all players have paid the buy-in, have all
    their cards, and the first 3 cards are placed down. A player MAY
    call a previous player’s bet and match it with their own chips if
    there are less than five cards on the table. A player MAY raise
    another player’s bet, matching it and then betting higher than the
    previous bet. A player MAY also check, but only where there is no
    previous bet – this means that they do not raise.

7.  A player is never unable to bet – if they do not have the required
    amount to match a previous bet, they MAY go all in and the above all
    in rules will be used.

8.  When there are five cards on the table, players MAY continue betting
    and folding. If all players decide to check after the river, then
    the game is finished, and the players MUST show their hands.

9.  Any action to raise, fold, check, call, etc SHOULD be vocalised: the
    player SHOULD clearly announce their intentions – the dealer MAY
    accept a ‘knocking’ on the table to signify a check but MAY request
    clarification if they deem an action to be ambiguous.

10. A player’s first action is accepted and CANNOT be changed (for
    example if a player says that they check, then say that they raise,
    the action of checking is accepted only.)

11. The Dealer MAY decide to call to a close betting when there are five
    cards. The game will finish, with players showing their cards.

12. The Staff of the Casino make the ultimate, unanimous, decision
    regarding which player had the strongest hand and has thus won.

13. Typical Poker rules apply.
    
    6.  *Typical Poker rules* are defined as rules where it is
        demonstrated they are in use across multiple independent
        Casinos.
    
    7.  These rules CANNOT be found to invalidate this contract or its
        terms.
    
    8.  These rules MAY be invalidated by Management, with consensus.

14. Member’s SHOULD NOT collaborate with other Member’s in a manner
    which presents an unfair advantage, for example, by showing each
    other their hands or otherwise acting outside of what would be
    considered normal etiquette

### VI: Poker Stars / Coundon Coins

Poker Stars (also known as Coundon Coins) have been revised such that:

  - Any member MAY hand in 1 Coundon Coin in exchange for 3000 chips.

  - Coundon Coins SHALL NOT be exchanged for chips; Coundon coins are no
    longer given a return value, as they are no longer designed to be
    returned.

These revisions *MAY* be altered by Management, such that Poker Stars
MAY be returned in exchange for chips – but only in circumstances where
it is fair and deemed necessary, by consensus of Management.

### VII: Poker Rake

1.  The Casino has the authority to enforce a rake within any poker game
    in the Casino.

2.  Rakes are a scaled commission fee, taken to support the wages, staff
    and costs incurred by running this Casino.

3.  The rake is set to the main discretion of the Dealer, following
    order of seniority of Staff – with exceptions under cases of
    mandatory recusals if the rake applies to the Staff member. The rake
    is taken into the Casino’s vault at the end of all rounds of a poker
    game.
    
    1.  The rake SHALL NOT be altered, increased or changed except for
        the levels and conditions set about below or elsewhere in these
        Terms.
    
    2.  Under normal conditions, the rake is set to 10%
    
    3.  When applied against a staff member, the rake is set to 7.5%
    
    4.  When applied against a Management member, the rake is set to 5%
    
    5.  The rake MAY be altered by other clauses within these Terms.
    
    6.  In the case of any player going all-in, the rake is set to 15%.
    
    7.  The Casino MAY take a minimum rake of 25 chips, regardless of
        any rounding of any percentages. Whether or not the rake is
        round is left to the discretion of the Casino, following
        standard recusal procedures.

## VIII: Blackjack

1.  The player MAY bet any reasonable amount, with a minimum of 50, and
    no more than 1000

2.  If a player receives two cards of the same value, they MAY split
    their cards into two hands.
    
    1.  The player MUST then match their current bet for their
        additional hand
    
    2.  The player MAY win with either, or both, of their hands
    
    3.  The player does not immediately lose if one hand is bust
    
    4.  The player MAY stick with either, or both, of their hands
    
    5.  The player MUST be dealt two more cards for each hand – the new
        card is placed face-up for the left hand, but face-down for the
        right hand.
    
    6.  The player MUST first start hitting on their left hand. Once
        they have stuck or gone bust on that hand, they MUST then move
        to their right hand, at which point they MAY then look at the
        face-down card.
    
    7.  The player MAY NOT start hitting again on their first hand once
        they have moved to their second.

3.  The player MAY decide to double-down their hand if they have not yet
    hit.

<!-- end list -->

1.  The player MUST double their current bet, and take only one
    additional card

2.  The player CANNOT hit again and MUST either stick with what they
    have or go bust if they go over 21

<!-- end list -->

4.  The player MAY decide to surrender their hand only when they have
    not yet hit.
    
    1.  The player takes back half of their bet, and the other half goes
        to the dealer

5.  Once a player wins, the dealer will match their bet and the player
    will receive this amount.

6.  If a player (or the dealer) immediately gets 21 with only two cards
    (this is called a *‘natural’* or *‘blackjack’*) (i.e., an ace and
    any ‘ten-card’), the following conditions apply:

<!-- end list -->

1.  If any player gets a natural, and the dealer does not, the dealer
    immediately matches the players’ bets and gives them this amount.

2.  If the dealer has a natural, he immediately takes the bets of all
    players that do not have a natural.

3.  The dealer MAY look at their face-down card if their face-up card
    would allow a natural (i.e. an ace or a ten-card)

<!-- end list -->

7.  If the Dealer’s face up card is an Ace, any player MAY place
    *Insurance.*

<!-- end list -->

1.  Insurance is kept separate from the player’s main bet and is a
    maximum bet of half of their main bet.

2.  If the dealer’s second (face-down) card is not a ten-card, then
    players lose the amount that they insured.

3.  If the dealer’s second (face-down) card is any ten-card then the
    players that have paid insurance do not lose either of their bets.

<!-- end list -->

8.  All players play against the Dealer, if they get a higher amount
    than the Dealer, their bet is matched. The game continues for each
    player until all players have either stuck or folded; at that point,
    the Dealer hits themselves until they either win, are forced to
    stick or bust.
    
    2.  For instances where the player(s) or Dealer gets a blackjack
        (Ace + Ten card), then see above.

9.  The Staff make the ultimate decision of who, and how much, has been
    won.

Four Aces Contracts

These are the MarkDown versions of the word documents that is used to generate the contracts.

Note that the numbering list system *does* reset.

That means that this:

```
12) Blah blah
   a) Stuff
   b) Stuff
13) Things
14) Things
   c) Things
   d) More things
```

Will be displayed as this in the final PDF version:

```
12) Blah blah
   a) Stuff
   b) Stuff
13) Things
14) Things
   a) Things
   b) More things
```

## Want a change to be made?

Check out the [issue page](https://github.com/CheAle14/FourAcesContracts/issues) to raise an issue to have a clause, top-level clause or section revised.

### What is a clause, top-level clause?

```
13)
   a) This is a clause, its reference would be 13a
14) This is also a clause, but is considered top-level
15) This is, too, a top-level clause
   a) But it also has another clause under it
```

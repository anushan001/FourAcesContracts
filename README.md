Four Aces Contracts

These are the MarkDown versions of the word documents that is used to generate the contracts.

Note that the numbering list system *does* reset.

That means that this:

```
12) Blah blah
   a) Stuff
   b) Stuff
13) Things
14) Things
   c) Things
   d) More things
```

Will be displayed as this in the final PDF version:

```
12) Blah blah
   a) Stuff
   b) Stuff
13) Things
14) Things
   a) Things
   b) More things
```
